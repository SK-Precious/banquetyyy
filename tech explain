### 🧠 4. AI Agent Integration (OpenAI + Supabase Edge)

| Agent              | Status                                   | Description |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Welcome Agent      | ✅ Sends WhatsApp intro message           |             |
| AI Quote Agent     | ✅ Calls FastAPI or GPT for pricing logic |             |
| Booking Confirm    | ✅ Automated message post-confirmation    |             |
| Reminder Agent     | ✅ Tasting/payment/event reminders        |             |

| Concierge Agent    | ✅ GPT Q\&A – natural language enabled    |             |

All agents are routed through **Supabase Edge Functions** using secure `OPENAI_API_KEY` + `TWILIO_*` secrets.

---

### 📤 5. WhatsApp Integration (Twilio)

* WhatsApp Sandbox used for dev (free)
* Twilio secrets stored securely:

  * `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
  * `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
  * `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER`
* Functions:

  * `send-welcome`
  * `send-quote`
  * `send-reminder`, etc.
* Edge Functions trigger messages via WhatsApp with templates, logs sent to `messages` table

✅ Status: Fully working
🟡 Pending: Upgrade to Twilio-approved number for production

---

### 🔐 6. Financial Data Encryption

* `leads` table now includes encrypted fields:

  * `price_quote_encrypted`
  * `gst_encrypted`
  * `fd_encrypted`
  * `ad_encrypted`

* Admin-only Edge Function: `decrypt-financial`

* AES-256-CBC encryption using a 32-byte Supabase secret:

  ```
  FINANCIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY = <already configured>
  ```

* Non-admin users (staff) submit changes for financials, which are:

  * Logged
  * Signed
  * Require admin (000) approval

---

### 🧾 7. Blockchain-Style Audit Log

* Table: `audit_log`
* Fields: `lead_id`, `data_hash`, `user_id`, `created_at`
* Row Level Security: **only admin can view**
* Each encrypted transaction generates:

  * SHA-256 hash of submitted financials
  * Entry into `audit_log`

Optional:

* Integrate OpenTimestamps:
  `curl -X POST https://a.pool.opentimestamps.org/submit -d "<hash>"`
